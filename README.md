This is a command line tool to find out what public activity those you follow have made on github.

Please note: Right now, this is in development - I am likely to break it at any point - check back in about a week for a finalish version

### To install

_Requires [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org)_
```bash
$ npm install -g whats-goin-on
```

### To use

```bash
# for today
$ whats-goin-on [githubusername]
```

### Thanks

While this does something totally different, I came up with this idea after seeing [jlord's](https://github.com/jlord) gardening repo. Check it out.

This is a very basic tool, but it's fun to write these things!
